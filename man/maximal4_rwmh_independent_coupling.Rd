\item{chain_state_coarse2}{a vector with coordinates of the second particle at the coarse level}

\item{chain_state_fine1}{a vector with coordinates of the first particle at the fine level}

\item{chain_state_fine2}{a vector with coordinates of the second particle at the fine level}

\item{identical_coarse}{a flag that is True if chains at the coarse level are identical (coincide) and False otherwise}

\item{identical_fine}{a flag that is True if chains at the fine level are identical (coincide) and False otherwise}

\item{tuning_coarse}{a list that contains parameters needed for genertaion of RWM proposal at the fine level: standard devation}
}
\value{
a list that contains state of the first chain at the coarse level, state of the second chain at the coarse level, state of the second chain, updated values of flags "identical_coarse" and "identical_fine", cost of proposal generation
}
